Ligeia

by Edgar Allan Poe
(published 1838)
  

And the will therein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the mysteries of51,9, with its vigor? For God is but a great will pervading all things by nature of its intentness. Man doth not yield himself to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.
- Joseph Glanvill

I CANNOT, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely where, I first became acquainted with the lady 0,6. Long years have since elapsed, and my memory 327,10302,8much suffering. Or, perhaps, I cannot now bring these points to mind, because, in truth, the character of my beloved, her rare learning, her singular yet placid cast of beauty, and the thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical language, made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily progressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown. Yet I belie865,8I met her first and most frequently in some large, old, decaying city near the Rhine. Of her family --I have surely heard her speak. That it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be doubted. Ligeia! Ligeia! in studies of a 72,7more than all else adapted to deaden impressions of the outward world, it is by that sweet word alone --by Ligeia --that I bring before mine eyes in fancy the image462,8who is no more. And now, while I write, a recollection flashes upon me that I have never known the paternal name 904,11was my friend and my betrothe46,7who became the partne154,8studies4,6finally the wife118,8osom. Was it a playful charge o860,8rt of my Ligeia? or was it a test of my strength of affection, that I should institute no inquiries upon this point924,12rather a caprice of my own --a wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate devotion? I but indistinctly recall the fact itself --what wonder 544,12utterly forgotten the circumstances which originated or attended it? And, indeed, if ever she, the wan and the misty-winged Ashtophet of idolatrous Egypt, presided, as they tell, over marriages ill-omened, then most surely she952,9 over mine.

There is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me not. It is the person of Ligeia. In stature she was tall, somewhat slender, and, in her latter days, even emaciated. I would in vain attempt to portray the majesty, the quiet ease, of her demeanor, or the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of her footfall. She came and departed as a shadow. I was never made aware of her entrance into my closed study save by the dear music of her low sweet voice, as she placed her marble hand upon my shoulder. In beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her. It was the radiance of an opium-dream --an airy and spirit-lifting vision more wildly divine tha3,6phantasi136,9hovered vision about the slumbering souls of the daughters of Delos. Yet her features were not of that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the classical labors of the heathen. "139,9no exquisite beauty," says Bacon, Lord Verulam, speaking truly of all the forms and genera of beauty, without some strangeness in the proportion." Yet, although I saw that the f713,829,9703,13a classic698,8ity --a946,10perceived that her loveliness was indeed "744,9," and felt887,9re was much of "811,11" pervading it, yet I have tried in vain to detect the ir845,11and to trace home my own perception of "the strange." I examined the contour370,8lofty and pale forehead --it was faultless --how cold indeed that word when applied to a majesty so divine! --the skin rivalling the purest ivory, the commanding extent and repose, the gentle promine19,7the regions above the temples; and then the raven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant and naturally-curling tresses, setting forth the full for878,10Homeric epithet, "hyacinthine!" I looked at the delicate outlines85,8nose --and nowhere but 31,7graceful medallions 894,8ebrews had I beheld a similar perfection. There were the sam754,8ous smoothness of surface, the same scarcely365,9ble tendency to the aquiline968,11harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit. I regarded the sweet mouth. Here was 339,9e triumph of all things heavenly --the magnificent turn of the short upper lip305,8oft, voluptuous slumbe159,9under --the dimples which sported, and the color995,10ke --the teeth glancing back, with a brilliancy almost startling, every ray 18,7holy light which fell upon them in her serene and placid, yet most exultingly radiant of all smiles. I scrutinized the formation92,8chin --and here, too, I found33,11407,8breadth, the softness 712,8majest70,7full994,13spirituality, of the Greek --the contou647,8the god Apollo revealed but in a dream, to Cleomenes872,8469,9Athenian. And then I peered into the large eyes of Ligeia.

For eyes we have no models 23,7remotely antique. It might have been, too, that in these eves of my beloved lay the secret to which Lord Verulam alludes. They were, I must believe, far larger than the ordinary 795,8our own race946,11 even full962,12fullest of the gazelle719,948,7be96,8valley of Nourjahad. Yet it was only at intervals --in moments of intense excitement --that this peculiarity became more than slightly noticeable in Ligeia. And at such 910,8was her beauty --in my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps --the beauty of beings either above or apart from the earth964,17the fabulous Houri87,8Turk. The hue66,8orbs was the most brilliant of black, and, far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length. The brows, 685,9irregular in outline, had the same tint. The "strangeness," however, which I found in the eyes, was of a nature distinc712,11formation, or the color, or the 767,8cy 688,8eatures, and must, after all, be referred to the expression. Ah, word of no meaning! behind whose vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much of the spiritual. The 888,10133,865,8Ligeia! How for long hours have I pondered upon it! How have I, through the whole of a midsummer night, struggled to fathom it! What was it --that something more profound than the well of Democritus --which lay far within the pupils of my beloved?904,12? I was possessed with a passion to discover. Those eyes! those large, those shining, those divine orbs! they became to me twin stars of Leda, and I to them devoutest of astrologers.

There is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the science of mind, more thrillingly exciting than the fact --never, I believe, notice119,9schools --that, in our endeavors to recall to memory 515,10long forgotten, we often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember. And thus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny 186,9's eyes, have I felt approaching the full knowledge of their93,12--felt it 963,12--yet not quite be mine --and so at length entirely depart! And (strange, oh strangest mystery of all!) I found735,9commonest object452,9universe, a circ4,7nalogies to theat 805,10. I mean to say that, subs666,8 to the period when674,10beauty passed into my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived, from many existences in the material world, a sentiment such as 549,8lways aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs. Yet not the more could I define that 905,9, or analyze, or even steadily view it. I recognized it, let me repeat, sometime789,9survey of a rapidly-growing vine --508,9ntemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a chrysalis, a stream of running water. I have 283,8in the ocean;105,8falling of a meteor967,24glances of unusually aged people46,8ere are one or two stars in heaven --(one especially, a star268,8sixth magnitude, double and changeable, to be found near the large star in Lyra) in a telescopic scrutiny of which I have been made aware of the feeling683,9been filled with it by certain sounds from stringed instruments, and not unfr107,9by passages from books. Among innumerable other instances, I well remember something in a volume of Joseph Glanvill, which (perhaps merely from its quaintness --who shall say?) never failed to inspire me with the s40,8; --"And the will therein lieth886,8dieth not. Who knoweth the mysteries of 954,8, with its vigor? For God is but a great will pervading all things by nature of its intentness. Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will."

Length of years, and subsequent reflection, have enabled me to trace, indeed, some remote connection between this passage20,8English moralist and a portion 90,7character of Ligeia. An intensity in thought, action, or speech, was possibly, in her, a result, or at least an index, of that gigantic volition which, during our long intercourse, 339,10give other and more immediate evidence493,8existence. Of all the women whom I have ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid Ligeia, was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern passion. And of such passion I could form no estimate, save by the miraculous expansi525,8ose eyes which at once so delighted and appalled me --by the almost magical melody, modulation, distinctness and placidity of her very low voice --and by the fierce energy (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of utterance)279,8wild word774,8she habitually uttered.

I have spoken of the learning o217,8: it was immense --such as I have ne440,9 in woman. In the classical tongues was she deeply proficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in regard405,8modern dialects of Europe, 856,19her at fault. Indeed upon any theme of the most admired, because simply 991,10bstruse of the boasted erudit361,9e academy, have I ever found Ligeia872,9? How singularly --how thrillingly, this one point in the nature of my wife has forced itself, at this late period only, upon my attention! I said her knowledge was s500,34 --but where breathes the man who has traversed, and successfully, all the wide areas of moral, physical, and mathematical science? I saw not then what I now clearly perceive, that the acquisitions of Ligeia were gigantic, were astounding; yet I was sufficiently aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself, with a child-like confidence, to her guidance through the chaotic world of meta728,8 investigation at which I was most busily occupied during the earlier years of our marriage. With how vast a triumph --with how vivid a delight 997,11much of all that is ethereal in hope --did I feel, as she bent over me in studies but little sought --but less known --that delicious vista by slow degrees expanding before me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden path, I might at length pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to be forbidden!

How poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after some years, I beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to themselves and fly away! Without Ligeia I was but as a child groping benighted. Her presence, her readings alone, rendered vividly luminous the many mysteries of the transcendentalism in which we were immersed. Wanting the radiant lust46,10eyes, letters, lambent and golden, grew duller than Saturnian lead. And now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over 50,8pored. Ligeia grew ill. The wild eyes blazed with a too --too glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became of 685,9parent waxen hue656,8grave, and the blue veins 827,9lofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tid555,10gentle emotion. I saw that she must die --and I struggled desperately in spirit w922,8grim Azrael. And the 962,8428,9passionate wife were, to my astonishment, even more energetic than my own. There had been much in her stern nature to impress me 746,9belief that, to her, death would have come without its terrors; --but not so. Words are impotent to convey any just idea of the fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled with the Shadow. I groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle. 809,11soothed --I 786,11reasoned; but, in the intensity 54,7wild desire for life, --for life --but 1009,11solace and reason were the uttermost folly. Yet not until the last instance, amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit, was shaken the external placid799,11demeanor. Her voice grew more gentle --1005,10low --yet 688,8not wish to dwell59,10wild meaning4,8quietly uttered words. My brain reeled as I hearkened entranced, to a melody more than mortal --to assumptions and aspirations which mortality had never before known.

That she loved me I sh782,9have doubted; and I might have been easily aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love351,14igned no ordinary passion. But in death only, was I fully impress182,12strength of her affection. For long hours, detaining my hand, would she pour out before me the overflowing of a heart whose603,11passionate devotion amounted to idolatry. How had I deserved to be so blessed by such confessions? --ho965,26curs745,12removal of my beloved in the hour160,8making them, But upon this subject I cannot bear to dilate. Let me say only, that in Ligeia's 313,10womanly abandonment to a love, alas! all unmerited, all unworthily bestowed, I at length recognized the principle of her longing with so wildly earnest a desire for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly away. It is this wild916,9--it998,9eager vehemence of 909,11life --but 1009,11that I have no power to portray --no utterance capable of expressing.

At high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me, peremptorily, to her side, she bade me repeat certain verses composed by herself not many days before. I obeyed her. --They were these:

      Lo! 'tis a gala night
      Within the lonesome latter years!
      An angel throng, bewinged, bedi943,10In veils, and drowned in tears,

"O God!" half shrieked Ligeia, leaping to her feet and extending her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of these lines --"O God! O Divine Father! --shall these things be undeviatingly so?982,11is 786,10be not once conquered? Are we not part and parcel in Thee? Who --who knoweth the mysteries 76,7will with its vigor? Man doth not yield him to 499,12nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will."

And now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white arms to fall, and returned solemnly to her bed of death. And as she breathed her last sighs, there came mingl875,8them a low murmur from her lips. I bent to them my ear and distinguished, again, the concluding word600,9passage in Glanvill --"598,115She died; --and I, crushed into the very dust with sorrow, could no longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and decaying city by the Rhine. I had no lack of what the world calls wealth. Ligeia had brought me far more, very far more than ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals. After a few month434,8fore, of weary and aimless wandering, I purchased, and put in some repair, an abbey, which I shall not name, in one15,11dest and least frequented portions of fair England. The gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building, the almost savage aspect of the dom268,9many melancholy and time-honored memories connect126,8both, had much in unison 96,8 feelings of utter abandonment which had driven me into that remote and unsocial region of the country. Yet alth188,9external 612,8ith its verdant decay hanging about it, suffered but little alteration, I gave wa939,8a child-like perversity, and perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows, to a display of more than regal magnificence within. --For such follies, even in childhood, I had imbibed a taste and now they came back to me as if in the dotage of grief. Alas, I feel how much even of incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and fantastic draperies, in the solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild cornices and furniture, in the Bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted gold! I had become a bounden slave in the trammels of opium, and my labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my dreams. But these absurdities must not pause to detail. Let me speak only of that one chamber, ever accursed, whither in a moment of mental aliena247,8led from the altar as my bride --as the successor73,8unforgotten Ligeia --the fair-haired and blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion, of Tremaine.

There is no individual portion551,8architecture and decoration733,9bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me. Where were the souls of the haughty fami631,8e bride, when, through thirst of gold, they permitted to pass the threshold of an apartment so bedecked, a maiden and a daughter so beloved? I have said that I minutely remember the detail219,10hamber --yet I am sadly forgetful on topics of deep425,8--and here there was no system, no keeping16,9fantastic display, to take hold upo8,6memory. The room lay in a high turret of the castellated abbey, was pentagonal in shape, and of capacious size. Occupying the whole southern face261,8939,8 was the sole window --an immense sheet of unbroken glass from Venice --a single pane, and tinted of a leaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or moon, passing through it, fell with a ghastly lustre on the objects within. Over the upper120,14is huge window, extended the trellice-work290,8ged vine, which clambered up the massy wall135,9turret. The ceiling, of gloomy-looking oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and elaborately fretted with the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semi-Gothic, semi-Druidical device. From out the most central recess697,9melancholy vaulting, depended, by 475,9chain of gold with long links, a huge censer 29,7same metal, Saracenic in pattern, and with many perforations so contrived that there writhed in and out of them, as if endued with a serpent vitality, a continual succession of parti-colored fires.

Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure, were in various stations about --and there w41,7couch, too --bridal couch --of an Indian model, and low, and sculptured of solid ebony, with a pall-like canopy above. In each of the angle243,9chamber stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite, from the tomb159,9kings over against Luxor, with their aged lids full of immemorial s787,8. But in the draping of the apartment lay, alas! the chief phantasy of all. The lofty walls, 795,9in height --even unproportionably so --were hung from summit to foot, in vast folds, with a heavy and massive-looking tapestry --1013,9of a material which was found alike as a carpet on the floor, as a covering for the 291,13the ebony bed974,8anopy 976,8bed, and as the gorgeous volut453,11urtains which partially shaded the window. The 809,10as the richest cloth of gold. It was spotted all over, at irregular intervals, with arabesque figures, about a foot in diameter, and wrought upon the cloth in pattern220,9most jetty black. But thes915,9 partook155,8true character133,9860,9only when regarded from a single point of view. By a contrivance now common, and indeed traceable to a very remote period of antiquity, they were made changeable in aspect. To one entering the room, they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities; but upon a farther advance, this a955,10gradually departed; and step by step, as the visitor moved his station in the chamber, he saw himself surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms98,7belong to the superstiti970,10Norman, or arise in the guilty slumber402,11nk. The phantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a strong continual current of wind behind the draperies --giving a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole.

In halls such as these --in a bridal chamber988,11is --I passed37,7the Lady of Tremaine, the unhallowed hou700,10first month of our marriage --passed them with but little disquietude. That my wife dreaded the fierce moodiness of my temper --that she shunned me and loved me 910,11--I could not help perceiving; but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise. I loathed her with a hatred belonging more to demon than to man. My memory flew back, (oh, with what intensity of regret!) to Ligeia, the beloved, the august999,8autiful, the entombed. I revelled in recollections of her purity, of her wisdom1009,9lofty, her ethereal nature974,9passionate, her idolatrous love. Now, then, did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all383,8es of her own. In the excitement of my opium dreams (for I was habitually fettered in the shackle274,9drug) I would call aloud upon her name, during the silence of the night, or among the sheltered recess912,10glens by day, as if, through the wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the consuming ardor of my 347,8for the departed, 215,8restore her to the pathway she had abandoned --ah, could it be forever? --upon the earth.

About the commence596,8the second month of the marriage, the Lady Rowena was attacked with sudden illness, from which her recovery was slow. The fever which consum33,7rendered her nights uneasy; and in her perturbed state of half-slumber, she spoke of sounds, and of motions, in and ab735,9hamber378,8turret, which I concluded had no origin save310,8distemper32,8fancy, or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influence251,9882,8itself. She became at length convalescent --finally well. Yet but a brief period elapsed, ere a 509,9re violent disorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering; and from this attack her frame, at all times feeble, never altogethe464,9ed. Her illnesses were, after this epoch, of alarming character533,11re a992,8recurrence, defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions558,8physicians. With the increase579,10ronic disease which had thus, apparently, taken too sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated by human means, I could not fail to observe a similar851,10in the nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her excitability by trivial causes of fear. She spoke again, and now more frequently and pertinaciously, of the sounds --of the slight 1001,941,7the unusual 29,7 among the tapestries, to which she had formerly alluded.

One night, near the closing in of September, she pressed this distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention. She had just awakened from an unquiet slumber, and I had been watching, with feelings half of anxiety, half of vague terror, the workings of her emaciated countenance. I sat by the side976,9bony bed, upon on225,9ottomans of India. She partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low whisper, of sounds 555,10then heard, but which 227,12hear --of 468,8962,15saw964,24perceive. The wind was rushing hurriedly behind th384,14and I wished to show her (what, let me confess it, 40,12all believe) that those almost inarticulate breathings, and those very gentle variations of the figures upon the wall, were but the natural effects of that customary 754,859,7wind. But a deadly pallor, overspreading her face, had proved to me that my exertions to reassure her would be fruitless. She appeared to be fainting, and no attendants were within call. I remembered where was deposited a decanter of light wine which 109,9ordered by her physicians, and hastened across the chamber to procure it. But, as I stepped beneath the light of the censer, two circumstances of a startling nature attracted my attention. I had felt that some palpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my person; and I saw308,8ere lay 384,9golden carpet, in the very middle of the rich lustre thrown from760,13a shadow --a faint, indefinite995,8of angelic aspect --such as might be fancied for the 964,11 shade. But I was wild with the excitement of an immoderate dose of opium, and heeded these things but little, nor spok758,8m to Rowena. Having found the wine, I recrossed the405,8, and poured out a gobletful, which I held to the lips of the 166,8 lady. She had now partially recovered, however, and took the vessel herself, while I sank upon an ottoman near me, with my eyes fastened upon her person. It was then that I became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall361,10368,8and near the couch; and in a second thereafter, as Rowena was in the act of raising 601,8 to her lips, I saw, or may have dreamed that I saw, fall within the goblet, as if from some 84,10spring 884,8tmosphere 167,8oom, three or four large drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid. If this17,7--not so343,9She swallowe342,10 unhesitatingly, and I forbore to speak to her of a circumstance which must, after all, I considered, have been but the suggestion of a vivid imagination, rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady, by the 35,11by the hour.

Yet I cannot conceal it from my own perception that, immediately subsequent95,8fall 566,8uby-drops, a rapid change for the worse took place in the disorder of my wife; so that, on the third892,12night, the hands of her menials prepared her 893,8tomb, and on the fourth, I sat alone15,7her shrouded body, in that fantastic chamber which had received her as my bride. --Wild visions, opium-engendered, flitted, shadow-like, before me. I gazed with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi139,9ngles143,14977,9varying figur986,10drapery, and 932,9writhing 67,7parti-117,9ires 22,7censer overhead. My eyes then fell, as I called to mind the 156,12s of a former 525,8o the spot beneath the glare235,8censer where I had seen the faint traces of the shadow. It was there, however, no longer; and breathing with greater freedom, I turned my glances to the pallid and rigid figure573,10bed. Then rushed upon me a thousand memories of Ligeia --and then came back upon my heart, with the turbulent violence of a flood, the whole of that unutterable wo with which I had regarded her thus enshrouded. The night waned; and still, with a bosom full of bitter thought322,9one only and supremely beloved, I remained gazing 682,10ody of Rowena.

It might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for I had taken no note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very distinct, startled me from my revery. --I felt that it came from the bed of ebony --1005,11death. I listened in an agony of superstitious terror --but there was no repetition 215,8ound. I strained my vision to detect any motion in the corpse 924,18t the slightest perceptible. Yet I could not 595,10deceived. I had heard the nois68,10 faint, and my soul was awakened within me. I resolutely and perseveringly kept my attention rivete93,7409,8. Many minutes elapsed before any circumstance occurred tending to throw light 317,9mystery. At length it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and barely noticeable tinge of color had flushed up736,8the cheeks, and along the sunken small vein80,9eyelids. Through a species of unutterable horror and awe, for which the language of mortality has no sufficiently energetic expression, I felt my heart cease to beat, my limbs grow rigid where I sat. Yet a sense of duty finally operated to restore my self-possession. I 314,8 longer doub37,7we had been precipitate in our preparations --that Rowena still lived. It was necessary that some immediate exertion be made; yet the turret was altogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by the servants --there were none145,8call --I had no means of summoning them to my aid without leaving the room for ma142,11--and this 650,10t venture to do. I therefore struggled alone in my endeavors to call back the spirit ill hovering. In a short period it was certain, however, 89,7relapse had taken place; the color disappeared from both eyelid and cheek, 745,8a wanness even more than that of marble; the lips became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly e159,9 of death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread rapidly the surface423,8body; and all the usual rigorous illness 294,9ly supervened. I fell back with a shudder upon the couch from which I had been so startlingly aroused, and again gave myself up to passionate waking visions of Ligeia.

An hour thus elapsed when (could it be possible?) I was a second time aware of some vague sound issuing 76,9reg77,11bed. I listened --in extremity of horror. The sound came again --it was a sigh. Rushing to the corpse, I saw --distinctly saw --a tremor 633,9lips. In a minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright lin458,9pearly teeth. Amazement now 27,10in my bosom with the profound awe which had hitherto reigned there alone. I felt that my vision grew dim24,7my reason wandered; and it was only by a violent effort that I at length succeeded in nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had pointed out. There was now a partial glow 216,9forehead and 194,10heek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame; there was even a slight pulsation at the heart. The lady lived; and with redoubled ardor I betook 739,19of restoration. I chafed and bathed the temples and the hands1,6used every exertion which experience, and no little medical reading, could suggest. But in vain. Suddenly, the color fled, the 737,10ceased, the lips resumed the expression 6,7dead, and, in an instant 145,9, the whole body took upon itself the icy chilliness897,8vid hue, the intense rigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of that 109,8s been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb.

And again I sunk into visions of Ligeia --and again, (what marvel that I shudder while I write,) again there reached my ears a low sob from the regi623,10ebony bed. But why shall I minutely detail the unspeakable horrors 737,8night? W957,11pause to relate how, time after time, until near the period462,8gray dawn, this hideous drama of revivification was repeated; how each terrific relapse was only into a sterner and apparently more irredeemable death934,11agony wore the aspect of a struggle with some invisible foe; and 860,9977,10as succeeded by I know not what of wild change in the personal appearance136,8corpse? Let me hurry to a conclusion.

The greater par309,9fearful night had worn away, and she who had been23,7once again stirred --and now more vigorously than hitherto, although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in its utter hopelessness than any. I had long ceased to 598,9or to move, and remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a helpless prey to a whirl of violent emotions, of which extreme awe was perhaps the least terrible, the least consuming. The corpse, I repeat, stirred, and 655,25before. The hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy into the countenance --the limbs relax526,8, save that the eyelids were yet pressed heavily together, and 968,9bandages and draperies of the grave still imparted their charnel character to the figure, I might have dreamed that Rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly, the fetters of Death. But if this idea was not, even then, altogether adopted, I could at least doubt no longer, when, ari226,10the bed, tottering, with feeble steps, with closed eyes, and with the manner of one bewildered in a dream, the thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpabl453,11middle of the apartment.

I trembled not --I stirred not --for a crowd of unutterable fancies connecte806,11air, the stature, the demeanor of the 493,8rushing hurriedly through my brain, had paralyzed --had chilled me into stone. 829,16but gazed upon the apparition. There was a mad disorder in my thoughts --a tumult unappeasable. Could it, indeed, be the living Rowena who confronted me?966,9272,8be Rowena at all --the fair-haired, the blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine? Why, why should I doubt it? The21,8 lay heavily about the mouth --but then66,7it not be the mouth of the breathing Lady 884,13And the cheeks-there were the roses as in her noon of life --yes, these891,8714,9730,8 cheeks278,8living 888,16. 888,10in, with its dimples, as in health, 781,16hers? --but had she then grown taller since her malady? What inexpressible madness seized me with that thought? One bound, and I had reached her feet! Shrinking from my touch, she let fall from her head, unloosened, the ghastly cerements which had confined it, and there streamed forth, into the r40,7atmosphere 6,7chamber, huge masses of long and dishevelled hair; it was blacker than the raven wing521,9midnight! And now slowly opened the eye473,9figure which stood before me. "Here then, at least," I shrieked aloud, "can I never --1010,12be mistaken --these are the full689,9 black1009,10wild eyes --of my lost love --of the lady 1010,9LADY LIGEIA."
